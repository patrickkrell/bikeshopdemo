# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

# Product.create(name: "seed-generated product", description: "Test", image_url: "http://localhost:3000/assets/bike1.jpg", colour: "black", price: "1200")
